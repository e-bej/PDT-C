# OriginalData
This is the root of the four data directories, where the ORIGINAL DATA as
copied from the previous final version of the four individual projects reside.
They have been then copied to the WorkData directory, where theyare being worked
on (annotation of m- and  a-layers, unification of PDT-Vallex).

There are four subdirectiories for the four original treebanks.

PDT-Vallex has a separate directory, PDT-Vallex.
