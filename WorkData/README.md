# WorkData
This is the root of the four data directories, where the annotation of m- and 
a-layers is gooing on, and from where the final data will be moved to 
the final publishing directory for packaging.

There are four subdirectiories for the four original treebanks. Chages are
going on in all four, even though annotation of m and a layers only in PCEDT,
PDTSC adn Faust. Unification of PDDt-Vallex causes cahnges in all four.

PDT-Vallex has a separate directory, PDT-Vallex.
