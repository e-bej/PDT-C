# WorkData
This is the root of the four data directories, where the annotation of m- and
a-layers is going on, and from where the final data will be moved to
the final publishing directory for packaging.

There are four subdirectiories for the four original treebanks. Changes are
going on in all four, even though annotation of m and a layers only in PCEDT,
PDTSC and Faust. Unification of PDT-Vallex causes changes in all four.

PDT-Vallex has a separate directory, PDT-Vallex.
